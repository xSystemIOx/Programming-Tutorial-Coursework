I had a problem were I cannot convert a transform to a variable I created. It turns out I declared the variable to `vector 3`, then I made the mistake again by declaring it as `GameObject`. The code ran after I declared it as `Transform`.  I got confused of when to convert and from which way to convert to. In the end I figured it out. My second problem was the object spawn really fast, I fixed it by making the script wait half a second befor spawning again. My third problem was that is spawn the object forward, my intention was to make the object launch upward. I fixed i by adding velocity on the correct axis.

I explored many ways to do a dialog system, I tried making the text just appear but it's not very efficient. So I research and found a way to make text appear when the player triggers something. This method requires text mesh pro and it allows the user to control the speed in which the text apears.

The pause menu was pretty easy. But I wanted a easier way to allow the user to quickly change what scene they want to reset. So I wrote the script to allow the user to enter the scene name they want to load to.

I didn't understand what the old money system was, so I had to do research on what the conversions are. Also I didn't know how to demonstrate this package. In the end I decided you allow the user to be able to add and subtract money with UI auto changing depending how much money you have.

I wasn't sure what to make. So i decided to put my dialog package and the pause menu together and think of a short game. So I decided to make a little maze game where the obstical are invisible.
